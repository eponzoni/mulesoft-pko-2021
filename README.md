# MuleSoft Partner Kickoff (PKO) 2021

This repository contains the source-code for the 3 system APIs and 1 experience API used for demonstration of "Unwired" API-Led Connectivity during MuleSoft PKO 20021 JAPAC, where Mary Joy Sabal and myself (Eduardo Ponzoni) have presented evolution of integration solutions from legacy to API-Led Connectivity augmented with an event-driven approach.
